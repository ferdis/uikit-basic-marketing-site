UIKit Basic marketing site
==
This example, Basic marketing site, is modelled upon Bootstrap's which can be found here: http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/examples/hero.html

There are a few incosistancies between UIKit and Bootstrap, and they begin to show themselves here. The main difference being highlighted here is spacing/padding/margins in which UIkit doesn't create additional spacing, whereas Bootstrap does.  Some non-breaking spaces were added for this template to appear marginally the same as in the Bootstrap example.

Another inconsitancy was Boostrap's hero unit - UIKit doesn't have that. What UIKit does have is panels and an article component. Both were added to demonstrate the differences between them.

Why
---
The idea behind this(and other uikit-*) repositories is to act as a comparison between UIKit and Bootstrap with regards to looks and design, functionality and markup.
Additionallity, it also serves as a quick baseline comparison of how both frameworks appear visually.
